	I write this so that someone might remember her as she was, not the... thing she has become. Melos was of the sea, her heart a song that only one other could truly hear. When he was taken from her, she did not despair, not at first. She searched. Oh, how she searched. Across stars and through silent darkness, she called for him.
	<br><br>
	But the void answered instead. It found her in her loneliest moment and twisted that beautiful song of love into a dirge of sorrow. The ocean's heart within her turned black with cosmic tears.
	<br><br>
	I fled. May the stars forgive me, for i couldnt do anything for her.
